# 40% ARCHAEOLOGICAL ZONE LIQUIDITY PROGRESSION HYPOTHESIS

## üéØ RESEARCH QUESTION

**"After price touches a 40% archaeological zone level, what pre-existing liquidity targets does price proceed to take, and when?"**

---

## üìã SIMPLE EXPLANATION

Imagine you're watching a movie where:

1. **BEFORE**: Market creates structure (session highs/lows, FVG gaps, daily extremes)
2. **EVENT**: Price drops/rises to touch 40% of previous day's range  
3. **AFTER**: Does price go back up to "collect" the highs it made earlier? Or down to collect lows?

**We want to predict what happens in step 3 based on what existed in step 1.**

## üî¨ DETAILED HYPOTHESIS

### **H-LIQUIDITY-PROGRESSION:**
*"40% archaeological zone interactions trigger predictable progression toward pre-existing liquidity targets, with measurable timing patterns distinguishing current-session vs next-session completion."*

---

## üìä ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### **STEP 1: PRE-40% SNAPSHOT (Market Structure Inventory)**
Before the 40% touch occurs, catalog what exists:

**A. Session Structure:**
- Current session high price and timestamp
- Current session low price and timestamp  
- Session type (LONDON, NY, ASIA, etc.)

**B. Daily Structure:**
- Previous day high (if not yet exceeded)
- Previous day low (if not yet breached)
- Current day high (if different from session high)
- Current day low (if different from session low)

**C. FVG Inventory:**
- All unfilled Fair Value Gaps created BEFORE 40% touch
- Gap price ranges (high-low boundaries)
- Gap creation timestamps and session types

### **STEP 2: 40% TOUCH EVENT (Trigger Point)**
Record exact moment:
- 40% archaeological level price
- Touch timestamp and session
- Touch accuracy (how close to exact 40%)

### **STEP 3: POST-40% PROGRESSION TRACKING (Target Acquisition Analysis)**
Monitor what pre-existing targets get hit AFTER the 40% touch:

**A. Liquidity Target Completion:**
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Session high taken? (When: same session vs next session)
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Session low taken? (When: same session vs next session)  
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Daily high taken? (When: same session vs next session)
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Daily low taken? (When: same session vs next session)

**B. FVG Redelivery Completion:**
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Which pre-existing FVGs get filled? (Full vs partial)
- When: same session vs next session
- Order of FVG targeting (nearest first, furthest first, etc.)

**C. Timing Classification:**
- **SAME SESSION**: Target completed before session ends
- **NEXT SESSION**: Target completed in following session
- **DELAYED**: Target completed 2+ sessions later
- **NO COMPLETION**: Target never reached

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS & STATISTICAL VALIDATION

### **Primary KPIs:**
1. **Session High Targeting Rate**: % of 40% touches that lead to session high completion
2. **Daily High Progression Rate**: % that exceed session to take daily highs
3. **FVG Redelivery Rate**: % that return to fill pre-existing gaps
4. **Current vs Next Session Ratio**: Timing distribution of target completion

### **Predictive Intelligence Output:**
- **"73% probability of session high completion within current session"**
- **"45% probability of FVG redelivery, 80% within same session"**  
- **"28% probability of daily high progression into next session"**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS

### **‚úÖ CORRECT ANALYSIS:**
- Track progression to **PRE-EXISTING** liquidity targets
- Measure **COMPLETION** of established structure
- Focus on **DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT** toward known price levels

### **‚ùå WRONG ANALYSIS (DO NOT DO):**
- New structure formation after 40% touch
- Rolling highs/lows within analysis window
- Generic "liquidity sweeps" without pre-existing context
- Time-based rather than target-based progression

## üìÅ IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Data Structure Needed:**
```json
{
  "pre_40_structure": {
    "session_high": 23180.5,
    "session_low": 23150.0,
    "daily_high": 23195.0,
    "existing_fvgs": [
      {"range": [23165, 23168], "created": "08:30", "session": "LONDON"}
    ]
  },
  "forty_percent_touch": {
    "timestamp": "14:35:00",
    "price": 23162.25,
    "archaeological_level": 23160.0
  },
  "post_40_progression": {
    "session_high_taken": true,
    "timing": "same_session",
    "completion_timestamp": "15:22:00",
    "daily_high_taken": false,
    "fvg_redeliveries": [
      {"range": [23165, 23168], "filled": true, "timing": "same_session"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Required Analysis:**
1. **Target Identification Engine** - Catalog pre-existing structure
2. **Progression Tracker** - Monitor post-40% movement toward targets  
3. **Timing Classifier** - Current vs next session completion
4. **Statistical Validator** - Calculate success rates and probabilities
