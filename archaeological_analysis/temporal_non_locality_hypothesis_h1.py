H1 HYPOTHESIS: Dimensional Session Architecture Theory

DISCOVERY CONTEXT:
2025-08-05 PM session evidence shows 40% zone event positioned with 7.55-point 
precision to FINAL session range vs 30.80-point accuracy for current range.

This suggests temporal non-locality - events 'know' their dimensional relationship
to eventual session completion before the range is established.

    relationships to both current and final ranges, and identifying the mathematical
    patterns that enable 7.55-point precision to future levels. The session_data
    contains timestamp-ordered events with prices, and you need to detect the
