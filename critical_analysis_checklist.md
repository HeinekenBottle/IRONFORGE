# Critical Analysis Checklist: Temporal Clustering Statistical Validation

## Executive Summary

This checklist provides a systematic framework for validating temporal clustering analysis, focusing on volatility artifacts, time window justification, and statistical traps that could invalidate results.

## üîç VOLATILITY ARTIFACT DETECTION

### Primary Concern: Could clustering be volatility artifact?

**Core Risk**: Volatility clustering (Mandelbrot, 1963) shows that "large changes tend to be followed by large changes" - creating natural temporal event clusters independent of market structure relationships.

#### A. Volatility Clustering Validation
- [ ] **Heteroskedasticity Test**: Run ARCH/GARCH tests on underlying price series
- [ ] **Volatility Regime Analysis**: Test if event clustering correlates with volatility regimes rather than structure
- [ ] **Volatility-Neutral Controls**: Create baseline using volatility-matched random periods
- [ ] **Cross-Volatility Validation**: Verify patterns hold across high/low volatility periods

#### B. Temporal Dependence Controls  
- [ ] **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Test for serial correlation in event timing
- [ ] **Detrending Validation**: Apply temporal detrending to remove time-of-day effects
- [ ] **Seasonality Controls**: Account for intraday/weekly/monthly seasonality
- [ ] **Market Microstructure**: Control for bid-ask spreads, trading volumes, market hours

## ‚è∞ TIME WINDOW JUSTIFICATION ANALYSIS

### Current Windows: ¬±30s core, ¬±60m news - Are these justified?

#### A. Window Selection Bias Assessment
- [ ] **A Priori vs Post Hoc**: Were windows chosen before analysis or optimized to data?
- [ ] **Multiple Window Testing**: Test 5-10 different window sizes for robustness
- [ ] **Window Sensitivity Analysis**: Plot significance vs window size to check for peaks
- [ ] **Theory-Based Justification**: Document theoretical basis for each window choice

#### B. Optimal Window Detection
- [ ] **Cross-Validation Approach**: Use train/test splits to validate window choices
- [ ] **Information Criterion**: Apply AIC/BIC to select optimal window sizes
- [ ] **Power Analysis**: Ensure sufficient events within windows for statistical power
- [ ] **Edge Effect Testing**: Check for boundary artifacts at window edges

#### C. Window-Specific Controls
- [ ] **¬±30s Core Window**: 
  - Justify vs market microstructure timescales
  - Control for order execution delays
  - Account for high-frequency noise
- [ ] **¬±60m News Window**:
  - Validate against economic news release patterns
  - Control for pre-announcement effects  
  - Test sensitivity to news importance/surprise

## üö® KEY STATISTICAL TRAPS

### A. Multiple Testing Corrections
- [ ] **False Discovery Rate**: Apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction (q=0.05)
- [ ] **Family-Wise Error Rate**: Consider Bonferroni if strict control needed
- [ ] **Permutation Count**: Ensure ‚â•1000 permutations for robust p-values
- [ ] **Correction Scope**: Define testing family (per session, per pattern type, global)

### B. Selection and Survivorship Biases
- [ ] **Cherry-Picking Detection**: Test on out-of-sample data
- [ ] **Survivorship Bias**: Include all sessions, not just "successful" ones  
- [ ] **Lookback Bias**: Ensure no future information used in pattern detection
- [ ] **Publication Bias**: Document all tests performed, not just significant ones

### C. Clustering Method Validation
- [ ] **Distance Metric Justification**: Why Euclidean vs. cosine vs. temporal distances?
- [ ] **K-Selection**: Validate cluster count with silhouette analysis, elbow method
- [ ] **Robustness Testing**: Bootstrap clustering results 1000+ times
- [ ] **Baseline Comparison**: Compare to random clustering, temporal shuffling

### D. Statistical Power and Effect Sizes
- [ ] **Power Analysis**: Calculate statistical power for detected effects
- [ ] **Effect Size Reporting**: Report Cohen's d, eta-squared, or domain-specific metrics
- [ ] **Clinical Significance**: Distinguish statistical from practical significance
- [ ] **Confidence Intervals**: Report CIs for all effect estimates

## üéØ RED-TEAM ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS

### Alternative Hypothesis 1: "Session Time Artifacts"
**Theory**: Clustering reflects market session boundaries and trading hour patterns, not structural relationships.

**Evidence to Check**:
- Events cluster around market open/close times
- Different patterns in different global sessions
- Time-zone dependent clustering patterns
- Weekend/holiday gaps creating artificial boundaries

**Validation Tests**:
- [ ] Shuffle events within sessions only (preserve session structure)
- [ ] Test on 24/7 crypto markets vs equity markets  
- [ ] Analyze patterns across different global time zones
- [ ] Control for session overlap periods

### Alternative Hypothesis 2: "Data Processing Artifacts"
**Theory**: Clustering emerges from systematic biases in data collection, processing, or event detection algorithms.

**Evidence to Check**:
- Event detection thresholds create temporal boundaries
- Data sampling frequency affects clustering detection
- Processing pipeline introduces systematic timing delays
- Round-number psychological levels create artificial structure

**Validation Tests**:
- [ ] Test with different event detection parameters
- [ ] Vary data sampling frequencies (1s, 5s, 1min)
- [ ] Process same data with different algorithms
- [ ] Test on synthetic data with known ground truth

### Alternative Hypothesis 3: "Confirmation Bias & Pattern Recognition"
**Theory**: Human tendency to find patterns combined with analyst degrees of freedom creates false discoveries.

**Evidence to Check**:
- Pattern definitions evolved during analysis
- Multiple pattern variants tested until significance found
- Subjective elements in pattern classification
- Retroactive pattern boundary adjustments

**Validation Tests**:
- [ ] Preregister all analyses before data access
- [ ] Use completely automated pattern detection
- [ ] Test on blind/coded data without pattern labels
- [ ] Independent analyst replication study

## üî¨ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Foundation Validation (Critical)
- [ ] Document all analysis decisions with timestamps
- [ ] Create reproducible analysis pipeline with fixed random seeds
- [ ] Implement multiple testing corrections
- [ ] Generate volatility-controlled baseline comparisons

### Phase 2: Robustness Testing (Essential)  
- [ ] Cross-validate time window selections
- [ ] Test alternative clustering methods
- [ ] Implement bootstrap confidence intervals
- [ ] Run sensitivity analyses on key parameters

### Phase 3: Alternative Hypothesis Testing (Important)
- [ ] Design tests for each red-team explanation
- [ ] Run analyses on synthetic control datasets
- [ ] Perform independent validation on new data
- [ ] Document negative results and failures

## üìä REPORTING STANDARDS

- [ ] **Multiple Testing**: All corrections applied and documented  
- [ ] **Effect Sizes**: Statistical and practical significance reported
