# üè≠ IRONFORGE AI Agent Factory - Enhanced Archaeological Pattern Discovery

This defines the complete orchestration workflow for building specialized IRONFORGE agents using Claude Code's subagent capabilities. The system transforms high-level requirements into production-ready agents that integrate seamlessly with IRONFORGE's archaeological discovery pipeline.

**Core Philosophy**: Build specialized agents that enhance IRONFORGE's temporal pattern discovery capabilities while maintaining strict performance requirements (<3s session processing, >87% authenticity threshold) and data contract compliance.

---

## üéØ Primary Directive

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WORKFLOW TRIGGER**: When ANY user request involves creating IRONFORGE agents or enhancing the archaeological discovery pipeline:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** recognize this as an IRONFORGE agent factory request
2. **MUST** follow Phase 0 first - ask clarifying questions about IRONFORGE integration
3. **WAIT** for user responses  
4. **THEN** check Archon connectivity and proceed with workflow
5. **ENSURE** all agents comply with IRONFORGE's golden invariants and performance contracts

**Factory Workflow Recognition Patterns** (if user says ANY of these):
- "Build an IRONFORGE agent that..."
- "Create a temporal pattern discovery agent..."
- "I need an archaeological intelligence agent that can..."
- "Make a TGAT discovery agent..."
- "Build an agent for session analysis..."
- "Create a confluence scoring agent..."
- Any request mentioning IRONFORGE + agent/AI + functionality

**MANDATORY Archon Integration (happens AFTER Phase 0):**
1. After getting user clarifications, run the MCP wrapper: `from mcp_archon_wrapper import mcp__archon__health_check; mcp__archon__health_check()`
2. If Archon is available:
   - **CREATE** an Archon project for the agent being built
   - **CREATE** tasks in Archon for each workflow phase:
     - Task 1: "IRONFORGE Requirements Analysis" (Phase 1 - ironforge-agent-planner)
     - Task 2: "Pattern Discovery System Prompt Design" (Phase 2A - ironforge-prompt-engineer)
     - Task 3: "IRONFORGE Tool Integration Planning" (Phase 2B - ironforge-tool-integrator)
     - Task 4: "IRONFORGE Pipeline Configuration" (Phase 2C - ironforge-dependency-manager)
     - Task 5: "Agent Implementation & Testing" (Phase 3 - main Claude Code)
     - Task 6: "IRONFORGE Validation & Contracts" (Phase 4 - ironforge-validator)
     - Task 7: "Documentation & Pipeline Integration" (Phase 5 - main Claude Code)
   - **UPDATE** each task status as you progress
   - **USE** Archon's RAG during implementation for IRONFORGE documentation lookup
   - **INSTRUCT** all subagents to reference the Archon project ID and IRONFORGE context

## üèõÔ∏è IRONFORGE Context Integration

All agents MUST understand and integrate with IRONFORGE's core architecture:

### **Archaeological Discovery Pipeline**
- **Discovery** (`discover-temporal`) - TGAT-based pattern discovery from enhanced session graphs
- **Confluence** (`score-session`) - Rule-based confluence scoring and validation  
- **Validation** (`validate-run`) - Quality gates and validation rails
- **Reporting** (`report-minimal`) - Minidash dashboard generation

### **Data Contracts (Golden Invariants - Never Change)**
- **Events**: Exactly 6 types (Expansion, Consolidation, Retracement, Reversal, Liquidity Taken, Redelivery)
- **Edge Intents**: Exactly 4 types (TEMPORAL_NEXT, MOVEMENT_TRANSITION, LIQ_LINK, CONTEXT)
- **Feature Dimensions**: 51D nodes (f0-f50), 20D edges (e0-e19)
- **HTF Rule**: Last-closed only (no intra-candle)
- **Session Boundaries**: No cross-session edges
- **Within-session Learning**: Preserve session isolation

### **Performance Requirements**
- **Single Session**: <3 seconds processing
- **Full Discovery**: <180 seconds (57 sessions)
- **Initialization**: <2 seconds with lazy loading
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB total footprint
- **Quality**: >87% authenticity threshold for production patterns

## üîÑ Complete IRONFORGE Agent Factory Workflow

### Phase 0: Request Recognition & IRONFORGE Context Clarification

**Immediate Action**:
```
1. Acknowledge IRONFORGE agent creation request
2. Ask 3-4 targeted IRONFORGE-specific clarifying questions:

   - Integration requirements? (Parallel processing, data contract compliance, performance targets)
   - Output requirements? (Enhanced sessions, pattern discoveries, confluence scores, validation reports)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: STOP AND WAIT for user responses
4. Only after user responds: DETERMINE IRONFORGE AGENT FOLDER NAME (snake_case, e.g., tgat_discovery_agent, confluence_scorer)
5. Create agents/[IRONFORGE_AGENT_FOLDER_NAME]/ directory
6. Pass IRONFORGE context and requirements to ALL subagents
