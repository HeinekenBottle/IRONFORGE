# Authenticity Validator Agent - Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary
The Authenticity Validator Agent serves as the critical quality gate for IRONFORGE's archaeological pattern discovery pipeline, enforcing the >87% authenticity threshold for pattern graduation to production. This agent ensures that only high-confidence, validated temporal patterns advance through the pipeline, maintaining IRONFORGE's commitment to precision and reliability in archaeological discovery.

## Agent Classification
- **Complexity Level**: High - Complex multi-dimensional quality assessment
- **Priority**: Critical - Core quality gate for production deployment
- **Agent Type**: Validation Agent with pattern graduation capabilities
- **Integration Level**: Deep - Integrates with TGAT discovery and pattern graduation

  - Manage pattern lifecycle from candidate to graduated status
  - Provide graduation audit trails and documentation
- **Priority**: Critical

### FR3: Quality Gate Management
- **Requirement**: Implement comprehensive quality gates for multi-dimensional pattern assessment
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Evaluate temporal coherence and consistency
  - Assess pattern stability across multiple timeframes
  - Validate archaeological significance and context
  - Apply confidence interval analysis
- **Priority**: High

### FR4: Real-time Authenticity Scoring

## Technical Requirements
- **Model Integration**: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini for authenticity analysis and quality assessment
- **Performance**: <500ms per pattern authenticity calculation, <5 seconds batch validation
- **Quality**: >99% accuracy in authenticity threshold enforcement
- **Integration**: Real-time integration with TGAT discovery and pattern graduation

## Success Criteria
- **Primary Metric**: 100% compliance with 87% authenticity threshold enforcement
- **Performance**: Sub-500ms authenticity scoring, <5 seconds batch validation
- **Quality**: >99% accuracy in pattern graduation decisions
- **Coverage**: 100% of discovered patterns validated for authenticity

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: False positive pattern graduation could degrade production performance
- **High Risk**: False negative rejection could discard valuable patterns
- **Medium Risk**: Performance bottlenecks during high-volume pattern discovery
- **Low Risk**: Threshold calibration drift over time

## Assumptions
- TGAT discovery provides sufficiently detailed pattern information for authenticity assessment
- Authenticity scoring algorithms remain stable and calibrated
- 87% threshold represents optimal balance between quality and pattern availability
- Archaeological context enhances rather than conflicts with authenticity assessment
