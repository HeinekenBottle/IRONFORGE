## üèõÔ∏è IRONFORGE System Overview

### What is IRONFORGE?
IRONFORGE is a sophisticated archaeological discovery system that uncovers hidden patterns in financial market data using advanced temporal graph attention networks (TGAT) and semantic feature analysis. The system transforms raw market sessions into rich contextual archaeological discoveries with complete event preservation and session anchoring.

### Core Mission
**Archaeological discovery of market patterns (NOT prediction)**
- Discovers existing patterns in historical data
- Preserves complete semantic context
- Maintains human-readable descriptions
- Never attempts future predictions

### Key Capabilities
- **45D Node Features**: Rich semantic event preservation
- **20D Edge Features**: Contextual relationship encoding
- **TGAT Discovery**: 4-head temporal attention networks
- **Session Anchoring**: Complete timing and context preservation
- **Production Ready**: <5s initialization, <3s per session processing
