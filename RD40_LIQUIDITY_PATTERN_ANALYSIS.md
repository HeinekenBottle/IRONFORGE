## 1. Introduction & Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Archaeological Zone Theory
Archaeological zones represent dimensional relationships to eventual session completion rather than reactions to current price structure. The 40% zone (RD@40) specifically identifies points where price action positions itself with temporal non-locality—events "know" their relationship to the session's final structure before that structure is established.

### 1.2 Theory B Temporal Non-Locality
Previous empirical validation (2025-08-05 PM session) demonstrated:
- 40% zone event occurred at 14:35:00 (23162.25)
- Session low established 18 minutes later at 14:53:00
- **7.55-point precision** to final session range's 40% level
- 4X more accurate than conventional retracement analysis

### 1.3 Liquidity Dynamics Hypothesis
The core hypothesis tested: RD@40 events serve as catalysts for liquidity operations due to their temporal positioning advantage, creating predictable sequences that can be systematically identified and exploited.
