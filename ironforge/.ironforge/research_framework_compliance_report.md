# IRONFORGE Research Framework Compliance Report

## Summary
- **Total Files Analyzed**: 3
- **Compliant Files**: 0/3 (0.0%)
- **Framework Adherence**: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

## Violations by Category


### TGAT QUALITY GATES MISSING
- TGAT QUALITY GATES MISSING: TGAT usage detected without authenticity thresholds - must enforce 87% quality standard


## Recommendations for Team

### Immediate Actions Required:
- Complex research detected - consider using agent coordination (data-scientist, knowledge-architect, adjacent-possible-linker) for systematic analysis and knowledge management


### Framework Best Practices:

1. **Configuration-First Research**
   - Always start with research_question and hypothesis_parameters
   - Use configurable percentage_levels instead of hardcoding 40%
   - Define discovery_method and validation_method explicitly

2. **Agent Coordination**  
   - Use data-scientist agent for statistical analysis
   - Use knowledge-architect agent for cross-session learning
   - Use adjacent-possible-linker agent for creative pattern connections
   - Use scrum-master agent for complex research project management

3. **Statistical Rigor**
   - Always include significance testing (p-values, confidence intervals)  
   - Enforce 87% authenticity thresholds for TGAT discovery
   - Use permutation testing for pattern validation
   - Document quality gates and compliance rates

4. **Research Methodology**
   - Let TGAT discover patterns rather than assuming event families exist
   - Test percentage zones as hypotheses (20%, 60%, 85%) not assumptions
   - Use temporal relationships as research questions, not hardcoded rules
   - Apply agent coordination for systematic analysis

## Next Steps

To improve framework compliance:

1. **Review flagged files** and convert hardcoded assumptions to configuration
2. **Implement agent coordination** for complex research workflows  
3. **Add statistical validation** to all pattern discovery work
4. **Create research configurations** that define hypotheses explicitly
5. **Use IRONFORGE's professional research capabilities** systematically

*This report ensures IRONFORGE is used as a flexible, research-agnostic platform 
rather than hardcoded to specific pattern assumptions.*
