**No changes required!** All existing usage continues to work:

```python
# This continues to work unchanged:
from ironforge.learning.enhanced_graph_builder import EnhancedGraphBuilder, RichNodeFeature, RichEdgeFeature

builder = EnhancedGraphBuilder()
graph = builder.build_session_graph(session_data)
node_features, edge_features = builder.extract_features_for_tgat(graph)
```

### For New Development
**Enhanced modular access available:**

```python
# Use individual modules for focused development:
from ironforge.learning.graph.node_features import NodeFeatureProcessor
from ironforge.learning.graph.edge_features import EdgeFeatureProcessor  
from ironforge.learning.graph.feature_utils import FeatureUtils

# Or use main interface:
from ironforge.learning.graph import EnhancedGraphBuilder, RichNodeFeature, RichEdgeFeature
