# IRONFORGE Research Hypotheses H1-H5
## Temporal Pattern Analysis Framework

**Status**: Level 2-3 Correlations (Per Research Quality Framework)  
**Evidence Basis**: 16 sessions, 57 enhanced datasets, Theory B validation events  
**Statistical Foundation**: 37.5% completion rates, 7.55-point precision thresholds  

---

## H1: Temporal Non-Locality in Archaeological Zones
**Discovery Level**: 3 (Validated Pattern)  
**Evidence**: Theory B precision events positioning within 7.55 points of eventual session completion

**Hypothesis**: Archaeological zone events demonstrate forward-looking positioning relative to session ranges that have not yet been established, suggesting temporal non-locality in market structure formation.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- 2025-08-05 PM session: 40% zone event at 14:35:00 positioned 7.55 points from final range completion
- Session low established 18 minutes after zone event
- 4X more accurate to final range (7.55 pts) vs current range (30.80 pts)

**Testable Prediction**: Events in 40%, 60%, 80% archaeological zones will position within ±10 points of their eventual session range percentile before range completion.

**Limitations**: Small sample size for statistical significance, requires validation across multiple timeframes and market conditions.

## H2: FPFVG-Hunt Sequential Dependency  
**Discovery Level**: 2 (Correlation)  
**Evidence**: 16 native FPFVG formations, 37.5% complete Gauntlet sequences

**Hypothesis**: Native session Fair Value Gap formations create directional probability biases that influence subsequent liquidity hunt patterns within 20-minute windows.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- 1.0 FPFVG per session average (realistic frequency validation)
- 62.5% sessions show hunt patterns post-FPFVG formation
- 7.87/10.0 average hunt significance scoring
- Directional consistency: lower hunts follow bullish FPFVGs, higher hunts follow bearish FPFVGs

**Testable Prediction**: FPFVG formations will precede directionally-aligned liquidity hunts in >60% of sessions within 20-minute windows.

**Limitations**: Correlation does not establish causation, requires controlled testing across different market volatility conditions.

## H3: Macro Window Structural Coherence
**Discovery Level**: 2 (Correlation)  
**Evidence**: 9:50-10:10 AM ET optimal timing alignment, enhanced session data

**Hypothesis**: The 9:50-10:10 AM ET window represents a structural coherence period where FPFVG-hunt-reversal sequences show increased completion probability.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- 37.5% completion rate for full Gauntlet sequences
- Macro window alignment with ICT timing theory
- Hunt detection optimization within 20-minute post-FPFVG windows
- Session boundary logic validation

**Testable Prediction**: Gauntlet sequence completion rates will be significantly higher during 9:50-10:10 AM ET compared to other 20-minute periods.

**Limitations**: Limited to AM sessions, requires comparison with other time windows for statistical validation.

## H4: Archaeological-Liquidity Event Confluence
**Discovery Level**: 2 (Correlation)  
**Evidence**: 37.5% archaeological confluence rate, f8 liquidity spike correlations

**Hypothesis**: Archaeological zone positioning correlates with f8 liquidity spike events, creating predictive value for sequence completion probability.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Theory B + f8 correlation analysis framework
- 5-minute temporal correlation windows
- Archaeological zone proximity thresholds (±10 points)
- Enhanced pattern weighting systems (1.0-8.0 significance scoring)

**Testable Prediction**: Sessions with archaeological zone + f8 liquidity spike confluences will show >50% higher Gauntlet completion rates.

**Limitations**: Correlation analysis only, requires larger sample size and independent validation of f8 spike detection accuracy.

---

## H5: Multi-Scale Temporal Resonance
**Discovery Level**: 1 (Observation)  
**Evidence**: HTF cascade timing, Fractal Hawkes integration, temporal echo analysis

**Hypothesis**: Pattern completion probabilities exhibit resonance effects across multiple timeframes (M1, M5, M15, H1), where alignment increases sequence completion likelihood.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- HTF Master-Subordinate architecture (70% accuracy validation)
- Fractal timeframe variations noted in development roadmap
- Multi-scale Hawkes process integration
- Bayesian inference adaptive coupling

**Testable Prediction**: Gauntlet sequences with H1 breakout alignment will show >20% higher completion rates than those without multi-timeframe confirmation.

**Limitations**: Observational level only, requires implementation of multi-timeframe alignment detection and statistical validation across timeframes.

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### Statistical Validation Needed
- **Sample Size**: Minimum n=30 sessions per hypothesis test
- **Significance**: p-values <0.05 for correlation claims
- **Effect Size**: Meaningful differences (>10% improvement in prediction accuracy)
- **Cross-Validation**: Independent dataset validation for each hypothesis

### Alternative Explanations to Consider
1. **Session Time Artifacts**: Patterns may reflect trading hour boundaries rather than structural relationships
2. **Data Processing Bias**: Systematic biases in event detection algorithms
3. **Confirmation Bias**: Pattern recognition tendency creating false discoveries
4. **Market Regime Dependency**: Patterns may be specific to current market conditions

### Next Steps for Validation
1. Implement hypothesis-specific testing frameworks
2. Collect larger sample sizes across diverse market conditions  
3. Design control experiments with randomized data
4. Establish independent validation datasets
5. Apply statistical significance testing with proper multiple comparison corrections
