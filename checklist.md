# Pre-Analysis Critique Checklist
**Project**: RUN_20250824_1404_MSCLUST  
**Framework**: Research Quality Framework  
**Mission**: Prevent false discoveries through rigorous validation

## 🔒 LEAK-FREE T0 DEFINITIONS

### Information Leakage Prevention
- [ ] **Strict Causality**: t0 events use only data available at time t0 or earlier
- [ ] **No Future Peeking**: Event detection algorithms cannot access post-t0 information
- [ ] **Session Boundary Integrity**: Session range calculations use only completed sessions
- [ ] **Archaeological Zone Validity**: Zone percentages computed from finalized ranges only
- [ ] **Forward-Looking Test**: Can t0 definition be computed in real-time without hindsight?

### Temporal Consistency Validation
- [ ] **Event Timestamp Verification**: All t0 events timestamped before outcome measurement
- [ ] **Data Pipeline Audit**: Verify no inadvertent future data contamination
- [ ] **Rolling Window Integrity**: Moving averages and indicators use only backward-looking windows
- [ ] **Calendar Alignment**: Economic events properly aligned with ET timestamps
- [ ] **Session Definition Lock**: Session boundaries defined independently of analysis outcomes

## 🔄 SEASONALITY-PRESERVING BASELINES

### Circular Time-Shift Control
- [ ] **Intraday Pattern Preservation**: Baseline maintains authentic session flow patterns  
- [ ] **Market Open/Close Effects**: Critical transition periods preserved in baseline
- [ ] **Lunch Hour Dynamics**: Mid-session liquidity patterns maintained
- [ ] **Calendar Event Timing**: News release timing relationships preserved
- [ ] **Weekend Gap Effects**: Session continuation patterns accurately modeled

### Market Structure Integrity
- [ ] **Volume Profile Matching**: Baseline preserves authentic volume distribution

- [ ] **Microstructure Effects**: Bid-ask spread and liquidity patterns preserved

## 📊 MULTIPLE COMPARISON CONTROLS

- [ ] **Pre-Registration**: Hypothesis count declared before analysis begins  
- [ ] **Primary vs Exploratory**: Clear distinction between confirmatory and exploratory findings
- [ ] **Effect Size Thresholds**: Meaningful effect size criteria defined pre-analysis

### Statistical Power Requirements

- [ ] **Power Analysis**: 80% power to detect meaningful effects confirmed
- [ ] **Effect Size Reporting**: Cohen's d or equivalent reported for all findings
- [ ] **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CIs provided for all effect estimates

## 🔬 CROSS-SAMPLE STABILITY

### Temporal Robustness Testing
- [ ] **Hold-Out Validation**: 20% temporal holdout for blind validation
- [ ] **Rolling Window Analysis**: Effects stable across different time periods
- [ ] **Regime Change Resilience**: Patterns persist through market regime shifts
- [ ] **Crisis Period Testing**: Effects maintain during high volatility periods  
- [ ] **Forward-Looking Validation**: Out-of-sample prediction accuracy verified

### Session Type Generalization
- [ ] **Multi-Session Validation**: Effects replicated across Asia/London/NY sessions
- [ ] **Holiday Period Robustness**: Patterns stable during holiday-adjusted sessions
- [ ] **News Event Sensitivity**: Effects consistent during high/low news periods
- [ ] **Volume Regime Testing**: Patterns persist across high/low volume periods
- [ ] **Volatility Adaptation**: Effects stable across volatility regimes

## 🎯 LABELING BIAS DETECTION

### Algorithmic Bias Prevention
- [ ] **Consistent Detection Thresholds**: Same parameters applied across all data
- [ ] **Blind Labeling Protocol**: Event detection independent of outcome knowledge
- [ ] **Inter-Rater Reliability**: Multiple detection methods yield consistent labels
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling**: Boundary conditions handled consistently
- [ ] **Quality Control Audit**: Random sample manual verification of labels

### Systematic Bias Testing
- [ ] **Selection Bias Check**: No cherry-picking of favorable time periods
- [ ] **Survivorship Bias**: Include all sessions, not just "perfect" patterns
- [ ] **Confirmation Bias**: Test against null hypothesis, not just supporting evidence
- [ ] **Availability Bias**: Equal attention to disconfirming evidence
- [ ] **Anchoring Bias**: Avoid reference point dependency in thresholds

## 🚩 RED-TEAM ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS

### Alternative Explanation #1: Microstructure Noise Artifacts
**Hypothesis**: Clustering patterns are algorithmic trading artifacts, not genuine market intelligence.
- **Mechanism**: HFT algorithms create pseudo-patterns through latency arbitrage
- **Test Protocol**: Compare effects during high vs low HFT activity periods  
- **Falsification**: Pattern strength should correlate with algorithmic trading volume
- **Red Flag**: Perfect correlations during specific trading system deployment periods

### Alternative Explanation #2: Calendar Effect Confounding  
**Hypothesis**: Apparent clustering is actually calendar-driven seasonality misattributed to market intelligence.
- **Mechanism**: FOMC meeting cycles, earnings seasons, or economic release clustering
- **Test Protocol**: Test effects while controlling for all known calendar patterns
- **Falsification**: Effects should disappear when calendar events are properly controlled
- **Red Flag**: Effect timing perfectly aligns with known institutional calendar patterns

### Alternative Explanation #3: Data Snooping and Overfitting Bias
**Hypothesis**: Patterns are statistical artifacts from excessive hypothesis testing on same dataset.
- **Mechanism**: Multiple testing without proper correction leads to false discoveries
- **Test Protocol**: Strict cross-validation on completely unseen data periods
- **Falsification**: Effects should dramatically weaken on out-of-sample data
- **Red Flag**: Performance too good to be true (>90% accuracy on financial time series)

## 📋 RESEARCH QUALITY FRAMEWORK MONITORING

### Evidence Level Classification
- **Level 1 (Observation)**: Pattern noted, descriptive statistics only
- **Level 2 (Correlation)**: Statistical significance (p < 0.05) with proper controls
- **Level 3 (Validated)**: Replicated across multiple independent datasets
- **Level 4 (Predictive)**: Forward-looking accuracy on unseen data
- **Level 5 (Breakthrough)**: Paradigm-shifting with peer review validation

### Claim Validation Protocol
For every finding, verify:
1. **Evidence Level Match**: Language matches actual evidence achieved
2. **Statistical Support**: Significance, effect size, and power adequate
3. **Alternative Testing**: At least one alternative explanation tested
4. **Replication Status**: Cross-validation requirements met
5. **Practical Significance**: Meaningful real-world implications demonstrated

### Banned Language Without Evidence
❌ "Breakthrough" → Requires Level 5 peer review  
❌ "Proven" → Requires statistical significance + replication
❌ "Revolutionary" → Requires paradigm shift evidence
❌ "Perfect" → Requires comprehensive robustness testing  
❌ "Production Ready" → Requires forward-looking validation

## 🎯 CONTINUOUS MONITORING CHECKPOINTS

### Real-Time Quality Control
- [ ] **Hypothesis Complexity**: Reject unfalsifiable or overly complex hypotheses
- [ ] **Statistical Assumptions**: Verify normality, independence, stationarity
- [ ] **Results Interpretation**: Prevent overstatement of modest findings
- [ ] **Causal Claims**: Distinguish correlation from causation rigorously
- [ ] **Sample Size Adequacy**: Maintain statistical power requirements

### Final Sign-Off Criteria
Before approving any findings:
- [ ] No obvious information leakage detected
- [ ] Baselines preserve relevant market structure  
- [ ] Effects survive at least one robustness check
- [ ] Language matches evidence level achieved
- [ ] Alternative explanations adequately tested
- [ ] Statistical power and sample sizes adequate
